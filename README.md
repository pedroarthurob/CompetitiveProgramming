# CompetitiveProgramming

My journey in Competitive Programming began during my high school years. Surprisingly, I've never really shared any of my code or solutions beyond the confines of virtual judging platforms.

The birth of this repository was motivated by a desire to become more actively engaged in this community and to provide a home for my incomplete code snippets, which I intend to revisit and refine over time. Additionally, I saw this as a golden opportunity to share my skills with all of you. 

Hence, within these digital walls, you'll discover solutions to various problems - primarily sourced from [CodeForces](https://codeforces.com/profile/PedroA) - alongside code sketches and works-in-progress.
